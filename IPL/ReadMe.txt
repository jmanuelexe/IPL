This is a Programming language that I have being working on as a hobie.

So far it your can create function as follow
function foo(param1, param2)
{
    
    print( param1+param2);
}


foo(2,3);

As you can see is a Dynamic language so variables don't have to be declare in order to be used.
support if, for Example.
//if
if (v>=1 && v<30) {
    print("is a valid range");
}
esle{
    print("this is not a valid range");
}

//fors
for v=1 to 40 {
    print (v);
}
